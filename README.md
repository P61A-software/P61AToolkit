# P61A Toolkit
P61A Toolkit is a software package for experiment simulation and data analysis at [P61A beamline](https://photon-science.desy.de/facilities/petra_iii/beamlines/p61_high_energy_wiggler_beamline_lvp/p61a_white_beam_engineering_materials_science_hzg/index_eng.html)
operated by 
[Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon](https://hereon.de) at Petra III, DESY. P61A Toolkit is being developed in collaboration between Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon 
([Institute of Materials Physics - X-ray Diffraction with Synchrotron Radiation](https://hereon.de/institutes/materials_physics/x_ray_diffraction_synchrotron_radiation/index.php.en)) 
and University of Kassel ([Institute of Materials Engineering - Metallic Materials](https://www.uni-kassel.de/maschinenbau/en/institute/institute-of-materials-engineering/departments/metallic-materials)).
The contact person for the project is [Gleb Dovzhenko](https://hereon.de/institutes/materials_physics/x_ray_diffraction_synchrotron_radiation/team/099147/index.php.de).

At the moment the Toolkit includes:
* **Viewer:** for viewing and fitting energy dispersive diffraction data from the beamline.
* **Stress:** for calculating near-surface residual stress distributions based on the output of the Viewer.

Currently in development are **Calculator** for modeling energy dispersive spectra and 
**Texture** for calculating texture distributions based on the **Viewer**'s output.

## Viewer
