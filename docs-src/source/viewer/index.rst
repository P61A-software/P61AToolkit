P61A::Viewer
############

Software for viewing the energy-dispersive diffraction data from the beamline and peak fitting.


********
Workflow
********

After you have collected data at the beamline, stress evaluation can be performed as follows:

1. Fit diffraction peaks using P61A::Viewer and export peak positions as ``.csv`` (can be opened by many programs: Matlab, Origin, Excel, etc.)

2. Calculate stress distribution based on the changes in peak positions over sample translations / rotations
